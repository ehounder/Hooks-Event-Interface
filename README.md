## Human-AI Crisis 2022: CBDC Programmable Money
**AI-Programmable Money is the biggest problem civilization has right now coming like 1984 gone digital.**

**Best Case Solution:** The [CBDC Governance XDAO](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) **liquidity providers** fund **USDC EUROC CBDCXYZ campaign contributions** to elected sponsors of legislative measures requiring their  bill of rights, freedoms, duties and so on rendered into the constitutional-financial inclusion of a **CBDC Bill of Rights** in the administration of **[CBDC programmable money (see Executive Order 14067 of March 9, 2022 Sec. 4)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets)** - in exchange for liquidity providers' **capital investments** in the [BIS global monetary and fiscal-taxation cryptocurrency reset](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/A-foundation-of-trust-Carsten-Frost-Shin). 

Thus all three of Ripple's innovative objectives of financial inclusion, retail-facing, and interoperability are at work, since 1/2 of the XDAO LP **liquidity provider** tokens are to be invested in the XinFin XDC Network seeking 7% compounded interest 1/2 funding sponsors of CBDC Bill of rights measures which members can withdraw at any time. However, **macroscopic financial inclusion** is of the essence. Consider the reality amid the human geopolitical monetary, fiscal, debt, everything...crisis increasingly the "smartest people in the world" have decided to start developing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. There is a reason for that: every engineer knows every complex system requires a restoring force or the broken system will self-destruct to the point there is no inclusion financial or otherwise.

Hence the smartest people in the world know it is the long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object of institutionalized geopolitical market manipulation which has generated the total field crisis requiring global reset. Financial inclusion is therefore about resetting public trust and confidence in respecting every nation's bill of rights when administering CBDCs thus generating a **macroeconomic restoring force**. Wherein, once again, the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) is operating as a vital transaction space for said human-ai geopolitical complex system restoring force.
